# Computer_organization_Assembler
A repository for storing and managing the code base for the the Assembler and Simulator project.

Description:
A custom made RISC V Assembler and Simulator written in C++ to convert RISC-V assembly code into machine code (binary instructions) for execution on a RISC-V processor.

Notable features-
- Support for a major subset of Standard RISC V assembly instructions.
- Perfectly Translates assembly code to machine code seamlessly.
- Basic error checking and validation of assembly code.

The project also includes a simulator that reads RISC-V assembly code, simulates instruction execution, and updates register and memory values accordingly.
- Supports RISC-V assembly instructions of types R, I, S, B, U, and J.
- Simulates execution of instructions and updates register and memory values accordingly.
